# My Dataquest Projects


This repository contains all my projects from the Dataquest.io website. 
These projects serve as reference notes for myself. There a lot of comments in order to show the process. 
At the end, besides the conclusion and the final analysis, there is a summary of what can be learnt and also further possible investigations.

### Step 01 - Project #1: Exploring US births
- Goal:
- Concepts explored: lists, dictionaries, functions, for loops
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .read(), open(), .split(), .append(), int()

### Step 01 - Project #2: Exploring Gun Deaths in the US
- Goal:
- Concepts explored: list comprehension, datetime module, csv module
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  csv.reader(), .items(), list(), datetime.datetime()



### Step 02 - Project #1: [Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2002.01%20Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales%20Data/Basics.ipynb)
- Goal: With a sample of 50,000 data points from the the full dataset of used car eBay Kleinanzeigen, the aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listing
- Concepts explored: pandas, functions, boolean filtering
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .read_csv(), .pivot_table(), .replace(), .describe(), .apply(), .isnull(), .columns, .shape, .head()

### Step 02 - Project #2: [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2002.02Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors/Basics.ipynb)
- Goal: With a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012, the aim of this project is to analyse the data based on different plots.
- Concepts explored: pandas, matplotlib, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, scatter matrices
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .plot(), scatter_matrix(), hist(), iloc[], .head(), .tail(), .describe()

### Step 02 - Project #3: [Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2002.03%20Project_%20Visualizing%20The%20Gender%20Gap%20In%20College%20Degrees/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv)
- Goal: Generation of line charts to compare the gender gap across all degree categories. Export of the final diagram created as an image file.
- Concepts explored: pandas, matplotlib, histograms, line plots, chart graphics
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .savefig(), .text(), .axhline(), .set_yticks(), .tick_params(), .set_title(), .set_ylim(), .set_xlim(), .spines(), .tick_params()

### Step 02 - Project #4: [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2002.04%20Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data/Schools.ipynb)
- Goal: NYC has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. In the last mission, I began performing some analysis. I'll extend that analysis.
- Concepts explored: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, correlations, regex, basemap, data analysis, string manipulation
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .scatter(), info(), .tolist(), .groupby(), .agg(), .concat(), .apply(), .strip, .merge(), .fillna(), .corr()

### Step 02 - Project #5: [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2002.05%20Star%20Wars%20Survey/Basics.ipynb)
- Goal: The FiveThirtyEight team has surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey and has collected data in order to answer questions like "does America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the star wares movies?". In this project, I'm going to clean and explore this data set.
- Concepts explored: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, data cleaning, string manipulation, bar plots
- Functions, methods, and properties used:  .read_csv(), .columns, notnull, map(), .dtypes, .rename, astype(), .mean(), .sum(), .xlabel(), .ylabel()

### Step 04 - Project #1: [Analyzing CIA Factbook](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/blob/master/Guided%20projects/Step%2004.01%20Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQLite%20and%20Python/Basics.ipynb)
- Goal: Based on the data from the CIA World Factbook, analysis of the population as of 2015, its growth rate, area of diffrerent countries, their density...
- Python/SQL concepts explored: python+sqlite3, pandas, SQL queries, SQL subqueries, matplotlib.plyplot, seaborn, histograms
- Functions, methods, and properties used: .cursor(), .read_sql_query(), .set_xlabel(), .set_xlim(), .add_subplot(), .figure()
SQL statements used: SELECT, WHERE, FROM, MIN(), MAX(), ORDER BY, AND
