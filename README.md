# My solutions to challenges and missions on Dataquest.io
Personnal backup of my code snippets.

Nothing really special here. My solutions run flawlessly but may differ a little bit from the corrected ones.
[There is a dedicated folder for the guided projects.](https://github.com/obrunet/my-own-dataquest.io-codes/tree/master/Guided%20projects)
